# cuhackit25

Developed by Joseph Skapin and Isaac Mayernik for the Clemson University Hackathon 2025, this is an Android app that utilizes Kotlin and Python to access the AWS and Bedrock services to generate a workout plan based on user-entered information.

THIS APP REQUIRES A .env FILE WITH AWS CREDENTIALS

CURRENTLY IT WILL NOT GENERATE A PLAN WITHOUT IT
